# Cryptocurrencies
Module 18
## Overview
Accountability Accounting, is one of our most important customers and a prominent investment bank.  Martha, a senior manager for the company stated that Accountability Accounting is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, theyâ€™ve asked you to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

THe data provided is not ideal and will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what Martha is looking for, we decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, Martha decided on a clustering algorithm. We will provide visuals so that Martha can provide info to the board.


## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to utilize lessons learned during this module to implement unsupervised machine learning.  We will use Python, Plotly, hvplot, and sklearn to process the data, clean the data, scale the data, and create Kmeans.

### Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
### Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
### Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
### Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
